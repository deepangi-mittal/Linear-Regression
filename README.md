## General Information
- Multiple linear regression is performed on the dataset.
 We are trying to understand the factors on which the demand for these shared bikes depends such as temperature, weather, humidity, holiday, etc. It will be used by the management to understand how exactly the demands vary with different features. They can accordingly manipulate the business strategy to meet the demand levels and meet the customer's expectations.
The Boombikes bike rental dataset is being used.

## Conclusions
- The R-squared value on training set and test set are similar which means the model is able to explain the variance well on the test set.
- The major steps included in the python notebook are data interpretation, data visualisation, data pre-processing, model training, feature selection, residual analysis, model evaluation on the test set.
- Demand of bikes depends on various features.
